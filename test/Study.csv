We do not fully understand how important types (species) of bacteria and packages of genetic material (genes) coding for antibiotic resistance move between humans, animals and the environment, or where, how and why antibiotic resistance emerges. This study aims to look in detail at the genetic level at bacteria in farm animals, human/animal sewage, sewage treatment works and rivers, to work out the complex network of transmission of important antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes. We will use this information to work out how best to slow down the spread of antibiotic resistance between humans, livestock and the environment.

STUDY BACKGROUND AND AIMS IN MORE DETAIL
Infections are one of the most common causes of ill-health in human and animal medicine, and are caused by a range of different micro-organisms, including viruses and bacteria. Amongst bacteria, there are some species, or types, of bacteria, which can live harmlessly in human and animal intestines, sewage, and rivers, but can also cause disease in humans and animals if they get into the wrong body space, such as the bloodstream or urine. Examples of these bacteria include E. coli, and other similar organisms, which belong to a family of bacteria called ""Enterobacteriaceae"".It has generally been possible to treat infections caused by bacteria using several classes of medicines, known as antibiotics. Different antibiotics kill bacteria in different ways: for example, they can switch off critical chemical processes that the bacteria need to survive, or they can break down the outer shell of the bacteria. In response to the use of antibiotics, bacteria have changed over time, finding ways to alter their structure so that antibiotics no longer have a target to act on, or by producing substances that break down the antibiotic before it has a chance to kill the bacteria. These changes to the bacteria's genetic code, so that they are no longer killed by an antibiotic, create antibiotic resistance. Bacteria can also acquire packages of genes that cause antibiotic resistance from other surrounding bacteria. This is known as horizontal gene transfer. Through these mechanisms, members of the Enterobacteriaceae family of bacteria have developed antibiotic resistance to a number of different antibiotics over a short period of time. In some cases we are no longer able to treat these infections with the antibiotics we have available.Studying antibiotic resistance and horizontal gene transfer in bacteria found in humans, animals and the environment is difficult because we cannot directly see how bacteria and their genetic material move between them. However, new ""Next Generation Sequencing"" (NGS) technologies allow scientists to look in great detail at the genetic code of large numbers of bacteria. Comparing this information across bacteria which have been living in the different parts of the environment (e.g. sewage treatment works, rivers) and in human and animal sewage allows us to see how bacteria have evolved to become resistant to antibiotics, and how resistance genes have been shared between them.This study will use NGS technologies to look at the genetic code of large numbers of Enterobacteriaceae bacteria found in humans, animals (pigs, sheep and poultry), sewage (pre-, during and post-treatment), and rivers. These different groups/areas will be sampled in different seasons of one calendar year to determine how antibiotic resistance genes move around between these locations and over time, and what factors might influence this movement. We will also be investigating whether various chemicals and nutrients in the water may be affecting how quickly horizontal gene transfer occurs. Understanding this is essential to work out how we might intervene more effectively to slow the spread of antibiotic resistance genes and bacteria, and keep our antibiotic medicines useful.","Detailed study at the genetic level at bacteria in farm animals, human/animal sewage, sewage treatment works and rivers, to work out the complex network of transmission of important antibiotic-resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes",SUBMITTED,2021-03-04T03:59:46

Although both plants colonize Antarctica, C. quitensis is mainly found growing in association with D. antarctica in more stressful areas, while D. antarctica is capable to grow alone in areas with higher abiotic stress. Positive inter-specific interactions play a pivotal role in the structure and functioning of several ecosystems in harsh environments, and possibly they play a role in Antarctic terrestrial ecosystems.In this study, we compare the rhizosphere microbiomes associated with Colobanthus quitensis, either growing alone or associated with Deschampsia antarctica, using shotgun metagenomic DNA sequencing technology for comparative metagenomics. This approach allows us to gain insight into the rhizospheric microbial community structure associated with C. quitensis and C. quitensis  D. antarctica, through the study of soil's microbial taxonomic diversity, including non-culturable organisms. Such analysis could also provide valuable information regarding microbial functional diversity. This functional diversity might be playing important roles in conferring different degrees of tolerance to Antarctica's harsh environmental conditions such as low temperatures, desiccation, and low water and nutrient availability, which could help to explain the enigma of the success of these plant species in such harsh environments.",Metagenomic analysis exploring soil microbial communities associated with Antarctic vascular plants,HARVESTED,2021-02-24T01:54:07

Little is known however, about its influence on microbial community structure and function. In 2008, we surveyed microbial communities and metabolic activities in seawater and on plastic on an oceanographic expedition through the 'Great Pacific garbage patch'. The concentration of plastic particles in surface seawater within different size classes (2-5 mm and > 5 mm) ranged from 0.35-3.7 particles m-3 across sampling stations. These densities and the particle size distribution were consistent with previous values reported in the North Pacific Ocean. Net community oxygen production (NCP = gross primary production  community respiration) on plastic debris was positive and so net autotrophic, whereas NCP in bulk seawater was close to zero. Scanning electron microscopy and metagenomic sequencing of plastic-attached communities revealed the dominance of a few metazoan taxa, and a diverse assemblage of photoautotrophic and heterotrophic protists and bacteria. Bryozoa, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria and Bacteroidetes dominated all plastic particles, regardless of particle size. Bacteria inhabiting plastic were taxonomically distinct from surrounding picoplankton, and appeared well adapted to a surface-associated lifestyle. Genes with significantly higher abundances among plastic-attached bacteria included che genes, secretion system genes and nifH genes, suggesting enrichment for chemotaxis, frequent cell-to-cell interactions and nitrogen fixation. In aggregate, our findings suggest that plastic debris forms a habitat for complex microbial assemblages that have lifestyles, metabolic pathways and biogeochemical activities that are distinct from free-living planktonic microbial communities.",marine metagenome Metagenome,HARVESTED,2021-02-18T20:09:11

With a large spectrum of applications, the impact of nanomaterials on natural ecosystems is a growing concern in environmental science and management. Methods for nanomaterials removal from wastewaters are yet developing and currently a significant fraction of nanomaterials escapes treatment plants. As a result estuaries are becoming the final repository for nanomaterials. The implications of this towards biota have been assessed, but usually at higher concentrations than the environmentally-predicted. Moreover, the impact of nanoparticles towards ecosystem services has seldom been reported.
The aim of this project was to ascertain whether deposition of copper oxide nanoparticles (Cu NPs) in estuarine sediments will change metal speciation and bioavailability, which will in turn impact the composition and functionality of the estuarine microbial communities. For this project we selected the Douro River estuary (North Atlantic), which is of major importance in its geographical area as its watershed drains 17 % of the Iberian Peninsula.
We performed a series of microcosms enrichment experiments exposing estuarine sediments to Cu NPs, of size <50 nm, at a concentration of 10 ng/g, tested for 4 h, 7h and 24 h. The microcosms pH and dissolved oxygen was monitored, as well as concentrations of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium. DNA was extracted from the sediment and sequencing was performed using Illumina Hiseq Xten to acquire 150 bp paired-end sequences. This generated 18 Gbp per sample, after filtering adaptor sequences, contamination and low-quality reads. Links were identified between the microbial community and ecosystems services they might provide, namely the service of removing fixed nitrogen, which is critical in eutrophic ecosystems.",Estuarine microbiome exposed to copper oxide nanoparticles,SUBMITTED,2020-12-25T09:40:37

                microbial community composition in environmental samples. 18S rDNA pyrosequencing
                has revealed a vast diversity of infrequent sequences, leading to the proposition of
                the existence of an extremely diverse microbial ""rare biosphere"". While rare
                microbes no doubt exist, critical views suggest that many rare sequences may
                actually be artifacts. However, information about how diversity revealed by
                molecular methods relates to that revealed by classical morphology approaches is
                practically non-existent. To address this issue, we used different approaches to
                assess the diversity of tintinnid ciliates, a species-rich group in which species
                can be easily distinguished morphologically. We studied two Mediterranean marine
                samples with different patterns of tintinnid diversity. We estimated tintinnid
                diversity in these samples employing morphological observations as well as both
                classical cloning and sequencing and pyrosequencing of two different markers, the
                18S rDNA and the ITS regions, applying a variety of computational approaches
                currently used to analyze pyrosequence reads. We found that both molecular
                approaches were efficient in detecting the tintinnid species observed by microscopy
                and revealed similar phylogenetic structures of the tintinnid community at the
                species level. However, depending on the method used to analyze the pyrosequencing
                results, we observed discrepancies with the morphology-based assessments up to
                several orders of magnitude. In several cases, the inferred number of operational
                taxonomic units (OTUs) largely exceeded the total number of tintinnid cells in the
                samples. Such inflation of the OTU numbers corresponded to ""rare biosphere"" taxa,
                composed largely of artefacts. Our results suggest that a careful and rigorous
                analysis of pyrosequencing datasets, including data denoising and sequence
                clustering with well-adjusted parameters, is necessary to accurately describe

We use this method to highlight the most likely interactions between Erysiphe alphitoides, the causal agent of oak powdery mildew, and other foliar microorganisms of pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.). Our results showed that infection by E. alphitoides is accompanied by drastic changes in the foliar fungal community composition but no significant change in the bacterial community composition. Our analyses highlighted 13 fungal Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and 13 bacterial OTUs that are likely to interact directly with E. alphitoides. Four of the fungal OTUs were phyllosphere yeasts. The fungal endophytes Mycosphaerella punctiformis and Monochaetia kansensis were highlighted as potential antagonists of E. alphitoides. These potential interactions will have to be validated experimentally. The study of the temporal dynamics of microbial networks during the course of infection also appears to be a promising research avenue, that will undoubtedly give deeper insights into the ecology of this disease.

Here we systematically described the impact of helminth infection on the GI microbiota in a herbivore-helminth system by comparing GI microbiota between acutely and chronically infected equine livestock and uninfected controls; and furthermore, we triangulated this data by profiling luminal and mucosal microbiota taken from throughout the GI tract at post-mortem in infected versus uninfected horses. The results revealed similarities between acute helminth infection models in mice and equines, suggesting that helminths may employ ubiquitous mechanisms in regulating host gut microbiota. Furthermore, the microbial signature of helminth infection was distinctly different between acutely and chronically infected animals, indicating that host adaptive immunity plays an important role in helminth-microbiota interactions. At post-mortem, data supported that from chronically infected animals, and also showed that the most profound impact of infection upon the GI microbiota was a significant down-regulation of methanogen populations.

The rumen is a known efficient environment for lignan metabolism, which comprises the breakdown of  SDG into secoisolariciresinol, then to enterodiol and enterolactone. The product  enterolactone increases concentration in the rumen as flax is added in the diet of ruminants  and the compound can be transferred to milk, benefiting human health by the functional food  intake, preventing many oxidative-related disorders such as cardiovascular diseases,  atherosclerosis, Alzheimers disease, breast-cancer and others. Although the knowledge on lignans metabolism in the rumen, little information is available regarding the microorganisms  linked to secoisolariciresinol diglucoside breakdown. The main bottleneck is that just few species of the rumen microbiome can be cultured in laboratory conditions, and thus, metagenomic approaches are needed to access the rumen ecology by-passing the in vitro culture. Therefore, a fosmid library was constructed using rumen microbes DNA inserts from the rumen of cows fed up to 15g/100g (dry matter basis) of flax meal, resulting on an 11,520 fosmid clones library, using Escherichia coli strain EPI300 as host bacteria.

Two out of 30 library plates showed effective secoisolariciresinol diglucoside breakdown, however, no metabolism products were identified and no putative gene linked to direct secoisolariciresinol diglucoside breakdown was identified from clones genome.

In the period studied, the fecal microbiomes of the developing chickens showed a linear-log increase in community richness and consistent shifts in community composition. Three successional stages were detected: the first stage was dominated by vertically-transmitted or rapidly-colonizing taxa including Streptococcus and Escherichia/Shigella; in the second stage beginning on day 4, these taxa were displaced by rapid-growing taxa including Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcus-like SVs; and in the third stage, starting on day 10, slow-growing, specialist taxa including Candidatus Arthrobacter and Romboutsia were detected. The patterns of displacement and the previously reported ecological characteristics of many of the dominant taxa observed suggest that resource competition plays an important role in regulating successional dynamics in the developing chicken gut.

This is despite asses and mules comprising almost half of the worlds domesticated equines, and donkeys being superior to horses/ponies in their ability to degrade dietary fibre. Limited attention has also been given to commensal anaerobic fungi and archaea even though anaerobic fungi are potent fibre degrading organisms, the activity of which is enhanced by methanogenic archaea. Therefore, the objective of this study was to broaden current bacterial, anaerobic fungal and archaeal knowledge of the equine hindgut to multiple species of equines. Taxa core to all the equine faecal samples (n=70) were determined and observations of the effect of equine type (horse, donkey, horse  donkey and zebras) on the hindgut microbiota conducted. Results: Equine type influenced both microbial concentrations and community composition. Donkeys generally were most distinct from the other equine types, with horses and zebra not differing. Despite this, a common bacterial core of 8 OTU and 16 genus level groupings of OTU was found in all the equines studied. This bacterial core represented a much larger proportion of the equine faecal microbiota than previously reported, primarily due to the detection of dominant core taxa belonging to the Kiritimatiellaeota (formerly Verrucomicrobia subdivision 5) and Spirochaete phyla. The majority of the core bacterial taxa lacked cultured representation. Archaea and anaerobic fungi were present in all animals, however, no core taxon was detected for either despite several taxa being prevalent and dominant.Conclusions: Whilst differences were observed between equine types, a core faecal microbiome existed across all the equines. This core was composed primarily of a few dominant bacterial taxa, the majority of which are novel and lack cultured representation. The lack of microbial cultures representing the dominant bacterial as well as anaerobic fungal taxa in the equine hindgut is of concern, and highlights an urgent need to isolate these taxa.

Campylobacter is present within the chicken gut and is the leading cause of bacterial foodborne gastroenteritis within humans worldwide. Infection can lead to secondary sequelae such as Guillain-Barre syndrome and stunted growth in children from low-resource areas. Despite the global health impact and economic burden of Campylobacter, how and when Campylobacter appears within chickens remains unclear. The lack of day to day microbiome data with replicates, relevant metadata, and a lack of natural infection studies have delayed our understanding of the chicken gut microbiome and Campylobacter. Here, we performed a comprehensive day to day microbiome analysis of the chicken cecum from day 3 to 35 (12 replicates each day; final n = 379). We combined metadata such as chicken weight and feed conversion rates to investigate what the driving forces are for the microbial changes within the chicken gut over time, and how this relates to Campylobacter appearance within a natural habitat setting. We found a rapidly increasing microbial diversity up to day 12 with variation observed both in terms of genera and abundance, before a stabilization of the microbial diversity after day 20. In particular, we identified a shift from competitive to environmental drivers of microbial community from days 12 to 20 creating a window of opportunity whereby Campylobacter can appear. Campylobacter was identified at day 16 which was 1 day after the most substantial changes in metabolic profiles observed. In addition, microbial variation over time is most likely influenced by the diet of the chickens whereby significant shifts in OTU abundances and beta dispersion of samples often corresponded with changes in feed. This study is unique in comparison to the most recent studies as neither sampling was sporadic nor Campylobacter was artificially introduced, thus the experiments were performed in a natural setting. We believe that our findings can be useful for future intervention strategies and help reduce the burden of Campylobacter within the food chain.",Comprehensive longitudinal microbiome analysis of the chicken cecum reveals a shift from competitive to environmental drivers and a window of opportunity for Campylobacter,SUBMITTED,2020-09-23T23:14:55

Co-infection experiments with an Escherichia coli strain carrying an oxygen-sensitive reporter suggested that S. Enteritidis competes with commensal Enterobacteriaceae for oxygen. Association with either spore-forming bacteria or commensal Enterobacteriaceae from adult chicken microbiota did not protect germ-free mice from S. Enteritidis colonization. However, a combination of Enterobacteriaceae and spore-forming bacteria conferred colonization resistance against S. Enteritidis at levels similar to those observed in germ-free mice associated with adult chicken microbiota. Combining spore-forming bacteria with a single avian E. coli isolate protected germ-free mice from pathogen colonization, but protection was lost when the ability to respire oxygen under microaerophilic conditions was genetically ablated in E. coli.

Nevertheless they remain poorly investigated compared to fungi in other habitats like soil. Especially the community response to anthropogenic stressors is addressed in a very limited number of publications only.Therefore, we created a mesocosm experiment along an artificial sidearm of a freshwater stream in Germany, to test the effects of three stressors on the community composition. 64 mesocosms were equipped with litterbags (filled with leaf litter from riparian vegetation) and former sterilized ceramic tiles, which serve as a standardized sampling area for biofilm communities. An initial period of two weeks for colonization of respective compartments was followed by two weeks with stressor exposure. As stressors we chose fine sediment, salt (NaCl) and a reduction of flow velocity and all possible combinations. Each stressor and combination was applied in eight replicates. In contrast to the majority of hitherto published fungal freshwater studies we did not use morphological criteria to assess fungal communities but used a metagenomic barcode approach of the ITS nrDNA marker.Clustering of raw reads into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) with CD-HIT-OTU and usearch revealed highly identical results between the two different algorithms. However, the detected 570 OTUs exceed the number of species detected with bait- and cultivation-based methods of former studies by factor three to ten. The unique study design with two different compartments enabled the identification of three different ecological gilds according to their compartment preferences. The first gild represents aquatic fungi, the second comprises amphibious fungi, while the third contains terrestrial fungi. Each gild is characterized by a unique stressor response supporting the idea to divide the total community of freshwater fungi into specific sub-communities. While aquatic and terrestrial fungi show no significant effect caused by the applied stressors, the amphibious fungi respond significantly towards the enriched salt concentrations. However we assume this signal to be a secondary effect since the amphibious fungi are highly correlated to algal communities, which are more prone to applied stressors than the fungal communities.",Metagenomic barcode approach of the ExStream Project 2014 for eukaryotes,SUBMITTED,2020-08-22T19:00:22

Given that strongyles inhabit the same niche as the gut microbiota, they may interact with each other. These beneficial or detrimental interactions are unknown in horses and could partly explain contrasted susceptibility to infection between individuals. To address these questions, an experimental pasture trial with 20 worm-free female Welsh ponies (10 susceptible (S) and 10 resistant (R) to parasite infection) was implemented for 5 months. Fecal egg counts (FEC), hematological and biochemical data, body weight and gut microbiological composition were studied in each individual after 0, 24, 43, 92 and 132 grazing days. R and S ponies displayed divergent immunological profiles and slight differences in microbiological composition under worm-free conditions. After exposure to natural infection, the predicted R ponies exhibited lower FEC after 92 and 132 grazing days, and maintained higher levels of circulating monocytes and eosinophils, while lymphocytosis persisted in S ponies. Although the overall gut microbiota diversity and structure remained similar during the parasite infection between the two groups, S ponies exhibited a reduction of bacteria such as Ruminococcus, Clostridium XIVa and members of the Lachnospiraceae family, which may have promoted a disruption of mucosal homeostasis at day 92. In line with this hypothesis, an increase in pathobionts such as Pseudomonas and Campylobacter together with changes in several predicted immunological pathways, including pathogen sensing, lipid metabolism, and activation of signal transduction that are critical for the regulation of immune system and energy homeostasis were observed in S relative to R ponies. Moreover, S ponies displayed an increase in protozoan concentrations at day 92, suggesting that strongyles and protozoa may contribute to each others success in the equine intestines. It could also be that S individuals favor the increase of these carbohydrate-degrading microorganisms to enhance the supply of nutrients needed to fight strongyle infection. Overall, this study provides a foundation to better understand the mechanisms that underpin the relationship between equines and natural strongyle infection. The profiling of horse immune response and gut microbiota should contribute to the development of novel biomarkers for strongyle infection.

Given the importance of the interaction between the gut-brain axis and gut microbiota under stress, we evaluated (i) the effect of two different weaning methods on the composition of gut microbiota across time and (ii) how the shifts of gut microbiota composition after weaning affect the host. A total of 34 foals were randomly subjected to a progressive (P) or an abrupt (A) weaning method. In the P method, mares were separated from foals at progressively increasing intervals every day, starting from five min during the fourth week prior to weaning and ending with 6 h during the last week before weaning. In the A method, mares and foals were never separated prior to weaning (0 d). Different host phenotypes and gut microbiota composition were studied across 6 age strata (days 30, 0, 3, 5, 7, and 30 after weaning) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results revealed that the beneficial species belonging to Prevotella, Paraprevotella, and Ruminococcus were more abundant in the A group prior to weaning compared to the P group, suggesting that the gut microbiota in the A cohort was better adapted to weaning. Streptococcus, on the other hand, showed the opposite pattern after weaning. Fungal loads, which are thought to increase the capacity for fermenting the complex polysaccharides from diet, were higher in P relative to A. Beyond the effects of weaning methods, maternal separation at weaning markedly shifted the composition of the gut microbiota in all foals, which fell into three distinct community types at 3 days post-weaning. Most genera in community type 2 (i.e., Eubacterium, Coprococcus, Clostridium XI, and Blautia spp.) were negatively correlated with salivary cortisol levels, but positively correlated with telomere length and N-butyrate production. Average daily gain was also greater in the foals harboring a community type 2 microbiota. Therefore, community type 2 is likely to confer better stress response adaptation following weaning. This study identified potential microbial biomarkers that could predict the likelihood for physiological adaptations to weaning in horses, although causality remains to be addressed.",The Effects of Weaning Methods on Gut Microbiota Composition and Horse Physiology,SUBMITTED,2020-08-20T16:35:16

This is particularly important during the process of domestication, where captive animals commonly suffer from gastrointestinal (GI) pathophysiology. Horses are a prime example of a domesticated species which suffers from a high incidence of (often life-threatening) GI disease. Some of the most significant factors affecting the gut microbiota in horses are diet, stress and drug administration, all of which are associated with the process of domestication. There are no studies, to date, which describe the effect of increasing levels of domestication on the equine microbiota whilst controlling effectively for confounding variables. Here we aimed to do this by measuring the GI microbiota of adult female Exmoor ponies under 3 management conditions, representing different levels of domestication. Faecal samples were collected from 29 ponies in the South West of the UK; ponies were categorised as Feral (n=10), Semi-Feral (n=10) and Domesticated (n=9), based on their management conditions. Diet was recorded and faecal counts were egg taken from all animals to assess parasite infection status. DNA was extracted and microbial composition identified via high-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. Bacterial communities were dominated by Firmicutes (36.71%) and Bacteroidetes (30.99%). Profound stepwise changes in global microbial community structure were seen in the transition from Feral -Semi-Feral- Domesticated groups  these changes were significant in a large number of bacterial phyla and at multiple taxonomic levels. In particular increases in members of the phylum Proteobacteria and Tenericutes were associated with the domesticated group; and increases in Methanobacteria were seen in the Feral group. Faecal egg counts were significantly different between groups, and regression between FEC and individual components of the microbiome revealed that a number of taxa associated with domestication level were also associated with parasite burden. Functional predictions based on microbiome data revealed increased amino acid and lipid metabolism in domesticated group, versus increased energy metabolism in feral group. Interestingly the semi-feral group had a wide variation in FEC and microbial alpha diversity and functional predictions were associated with disease pathways. In this study we have shown significant stepwise changes to GI microbiota due to domestication standardised in one breed of equine. A number of these changes were linked to parasite burden and, based on previous studies, the remainder are likely associated with diet. If we assume that the feral population has a more natural phenotype, akin to that with which horses have evolved, the data can potentially be used to provide bacterial markers of balanced gut homeostasis in domestic Exmoor ponies, and provide candidate markers in other equine breeds.

The dominant phyla in all samples were the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The evenness of the bacterial populations decreased after grazing pasture, and when a pony was moderately insulin dysregulated (P=0.001). Evenness scores negatively correlated with post-prandial glucagon-like peptide-1 concentration after a hay-only diet (r2=0.7, P=0.001). A change in diet explained 3% of faecal microbiome variability. We conclude that metabolically healthy ponies have greater microbial stability when challenged with a subtle dietary change, compared with moderately insulin-dysregulated ponies.

We collected fecal samples from 45 individuals in the last wild population of the highly endangered Przewalski horse (Equus przewalskii) in Mongolia. The horse population was monitered with binoculars and fecal material was collected within an hour (usually within minutes) of defecation, allowing each fecal sample to be associated with a particular horse. Extremely detailed metadata is available for the population investigated, including pedigree, age, social structure, health, reintroduction dates, whole-genome data and years of daily behavioral observations in the field. We will compare the gut microbiota of these samples to fecal samples collected from 36 wild, domesticated horses living in the same region of Mongolia, which will allow us to isolate the effects of domestication/species differences from effects of current diet.

Study Design: Randomized case-control study.Methods: 12 male Thoroughbred yearlings were recruited by random selection into 2 groups: a prebiotic group (receiving 30g/day FOS dietary supplement for 8 weeks) and a control group (no FOS supplement). Samples were taken prior to supplementation and subsequently bi-weekly and were analyzed through microbial 16S rRNA sequencing.

There were no significant global GI microbiome changes over time following FOS supplementation compared to the control group. Some saccharolytic bacterial species showed diverging (increasing in FOS and decreasing in control) patterns of abundance over time between groups.Main Limitations: The small sample number may reduce the relevance of the results. Also, additional factors, such as social interactions and individual wellbeing, could influence the GI microbiome.Conclusions: Contrary to previous culture-based studies, this preliminary study shows limited effects of FOS administration on the GI microbiome, however, the alterations in abundance of some saccharolytic bacterial species show potential for further investigation.

However, little is known of the fundamental biology of such interactions in other animal species; nonetheless, given the considerable economic losses associated with GI parasites, particularly in livestock and equines, as well as the global threat of emerging anthelmintic resistance, further explorations of the complexities of host- helminth-microbiota interactions in these species are needed. This study characterises the composition of the equine gut commensal flora associated with the presence, in faecal samples, of low (Clow) and high (Chigh) numbers of eggs of an important group of GI parasites (i.e. the cyathostomins), prior to and fol- lowing anthelmintic treatment. High-throughput sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons and asso- ciated bioinformatics and statistical analyses of sequence data revealed strong clustering according to faecal egg counts (P = 0.003). A trend towards increased populations of Methanomicrobia (class) and Dehalobacterium (genus) was observed in Clow in comparison with Chigh. Anthelmintic treatment in Chigh was associated with a significant reduction of the bacterial Phylum TM7 14 days post-ivermectin administration, as well as a transient expansion of Adlercreutzia spp. at 2 days post-treatment.

This study investigates, for the first time, the associations between acute infections by GI helminths and the faecal microbial and metabolic profiles of a cohort of equine youngstock, prior to and following treatment with parasiticides (ivermectin). We observed that high versus low parasite burdens (measured via parasite egg counts in faecal samples) were associated with specific compositional alterations of the developing microbiome; in particular, the faecal microbiota of animals with heavy worm infection burdens was characterised by lower microbial richness, and alterations to the relative abundances of bacterial taxa with immune-modulatory functions. Amino acids and glucose were increased in faecal samples from the same cohort, which indicated the likely occurrence of intestinal malabsorption. These data support the hypothesis that GI helminth infections in young livestock are associated with significant alterations to the GI microbiota, which may impact on both metabolism and development of acquired immunity.

No significant differences were found among groups at either sampling time, indicating absence of evidence of an influence of composition or diversity of the fecal microbiome, or predicted fecal metagenome, on susceptibility to subsequent R. equi pneumonia.

We employed a tractable approach consisting of a synthetic community of fully sequenced human gut bacteria assembled in gnotobiotic mice. The members of this community were selected to represent the phylogenetic diversity in a complete microbiota, but also based on empirical knowledge of their abilities to degrade various fiber polysaccharides and mucin glycans in vitro. The responses of this synthetic microbiota, and the corresponding impact on the host colonic mucus layer, to variation of dietary fiber were monitored by multiple readouts in conditions where mice were fed constant high- or low-fiber diets or daily alternations of the two. We show that starvation of dietary fiber diminishes the colonic mucus barrier by enhancing the activities of mucin-degrading bacteria. One-day alternations of the fiber-rich and fiber-free diets or feeding of a prebiotic diet still displayed thinner mucus barriers reflecting a residual increase in mucus-degrading bacteria and their mucin glycan-degrading enzymes.

Limitations of forensic entomology include uncertainty in the interval between death and initial egg deposition2, lack of insects during particular weather events or seasons3, and regionally specific blowfly larval growth curves and insect communities4. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that might avoid many of these limitations, because microbes are ubiquitous in the environment, located on humans before death, and can be reliably quantified using high-throughput DNA sequencing.

For 520 days, a six-man crew lived like astronauts in a specifically designed and hermetically sealed spacecraft-like environment. The MICHAm (MIcrobial ecology of Confined Habitats and humAn health, modified) study aimed to survey the microbial distribution and its community structure within the facility from the start to the end of the simulation study, and to investigate the impact of confinement. Therefore, the microbial load and biodiversity in the air and on surfaces as well as their changes over time were monitored.The cultivation approach showed that the overall microbial inventory in the air and on different surfaces was moderate compared to other non-confined rooms (air: 0 to 716 CFU/m3; average=86 CFU/m3; surface: 0 to 29,760 CFU/10 m2; average=675 CFU/10 m2). Despite the detection of fluctuations in microbial load over time and places, microbial hotspots were identified. Phylogenetic investigations revealed a higher diversity on surfaces than in air indicating the dominance of human-associated microorganisms (e.g. staphylococci). Besides cultivation-based analyses, the microbial community was also studied on the molecular level via PhyloChip analysis and next generation sequencing. The whole microbiome structure exhibited a significant change in structure and decrease in diversity over time, but potentially pathogenic microorganisms containing mobile elements increased during the confinement. Additionally, significantly different microbiome structures were identified for investigated modules.Since the majority of microorganisms were not harmful there was no alert and health concern due to potential danger caused by microorganisms. The scientific information obtained by our study is essential to evaluate biosafety risks, predict and mitigate the possible occurrence of biocorrosion, and improve the sanitary and hygienic quality of life for the crew inside closed habitats.",Preparing for the manned Mars journey: Microbiome dynamics in the confined MARS 500 habitat during simulated Mars flight and landing,SUBMITTED,2020-06-16T18:37:48

We performed an experiment with clonal lines of D. magna showing different levels of sediment-browsing intensity exposed to either bacteria-rich or bacteria-poor sediment or whose access to sediments was prevented. We find that the bacterial composition of the environment and genotype-specific browsing intensity together influence the composition of the Daphnia-associated bacterial community. Exposure to more diverse bacteria did not lead to a more diverse microbiome, but greater abundances of environment-specific bacteria were found associated with host genotypes that exhibited greater browsing behavior.

Treatment has been limited by a lack of understanding of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. Stunting is most likely associated with changes in the microbial community of the small intestine, a compartment vital for digestion and nutrient absorption. Efforts to better understand the pathophysiology have been hampered by difficulty of access to small intestinal fluids. Here, we describe for the first time the microbial community found in the upper gastrointestinal tract of stunted children. We studied 46 duodenal and 57 gastric samples from stunted children as well as 404 fecal samples from stunted and non-stunted children aged 2-5 years living in Bangui, Central African Republic and in Antananarivo, Madagascar, using 16S Illumina Amplicon sequencing and semi-quantitative culture methods. The vast majority of the stunted children showed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth dominated by bacteria that normally reside in the oropharyngeal cavity. There was an overrepresentation of oral bacteria in fecal samples of stunted children opening the way for developing non-invasive diagnostic markers. In addition, E. coli/Shigella sp. and Campylobacter sp. were found to be more prevalent in stunted children, while Clostridia, well-known butyrate producers, were reduced. Our data suggest that stunting is associated with a microbiome decompartmentalization of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by an increased presence of oropharyngeal bacteria from the stomach to the colon, hence challenging the current view of stunting arising solely as a consequence of small intestine overstimulation through recurrent infections by enteric pathogens.",Stunted childhood growth is associated with decompartmentalization of the gastrointestinal tract and overgrowth of oropharyngeal taxa,SUBMITTED,2020-06-14T15:01:53

However, very little is known about the impact of season on the dynamics of the microbiota in a pig farm setting. Methods: We performed a longitudinal study, investigating the changes in the nasal microbiota of different samples collected in the four seasons (winter, spring, summer and fall). We collected samples from 30 pig farms in Switzerland in each season from 2014-2015. This included nasal swabs from pigs (n=225), air samples taken in the pig confinement building (n=105), and nasal swabs from pig farmers working in these pig farms (n=154 from 48 pig farmers). As controls, nasal swabs from cow farmers (n=56 from 18 cow farmers) and individuals with no contact with farm animals (n=69 from 24 non-exposed individuals) were collected. Analysis of the microbiota was performed based on 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing utilizing the Illumina MiSeq platform and the recently developed DADA2 pipeline. Results: Alpha-diversity values were generally higher in samples received in winter with the exception of samples from the non-exposed controls which displayed low alpha-diversity values throughout the seasons with no significant differences. The microbial structure of pig farmers, cow farmers and non-exposed individuals was significantly influenced by season. Also, the farm where the samples were taken from influenced the nasal microbiota of pig and cow farmers. There was a stronger similarity for samples that originated from the same farm as compared to samples from different farms in winter and this farm-specificity was partially or completely lost in spring, summer and fall.Conclusions: Nasal microbiota of pig farmers is affected by the regular exposure to pigs throughout the year. However, season has a very strong effect on the nasal microbiota of pig farmers, pigs, and cow farmers, as well as the airborne bacterial composition.

In this study, we aimed to explore complex interactions between human host mtSNPs and the vaginal and placental membrane microbiome with associated risk of preterm birth.Methods: Maternal blood and placental tissue samples from 93 gravidae (n=54 with preterm deliveries between 23 and 0/7 and <37 and 0/7 weeks; n=39 term =37 and 0/7 weeks) were deep sequenced, and mtSNPs were called with high confidence. The microbial taxonomic abundance of the vagina (introitus and posterior fornix) and placental membranes (maternal and fetal side swabs) from the same subjects were obtained via 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing, and inferred metagenomics was employed for metabolic pathway analysis. Interactions among both microbial taxa and their inferred metagenomics pathways were examined for association with mtSNPs employing multiple linear regressions modeling for both genotype and clinical covariates with PLINK quantitative trait associations. Analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons, with a q value <0.05 denoting significance.Results: Consistent with ours and others recent published observations, we observed an association between preterm birth and the composition of the placental membrane microbiome community (PERMANOVA p=0.042). In our cohort, no significant association between any mtSNP with the occurrence of preterm birth was observed. However, overall associations between mitochondrial genome variations and both the vaginal and placental membrane preterm microbial community were observed. Of note, several functional mtSNPs (within coding regions for electron transport genes) demonstrated significant and robust associations (q value <0.05) with both occurrence and abundance of certain taxa and their metagenomics pathways among preterm births.Conclusions: We have demonstrated for the first time that maternally inherited human mtSNPs are associated with variations in both placental membrane and vaginal microbial taxa membership and their inferred metabolic function during pregnancy, and consequentially linked to the occurrence of preterm birth.",Integrated Analysis of mtDNA Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms with the Vaginal and Placental Membrane Microbiome and Rendered Risk Estimation for Preterm Birth,HARVESTED,2020-06-14T13:37:08

These adjacent regions show one of the most contrasting socio-economical differences in the world.OBJECTIVE:We explored changes in allergy from school age to young adulthood from 2003 to 2010/2012 in these two areas. The skin and nasal microbiota were also compared.METHODS:Randomly selected children from Finnish (n = 98) and Russian Karelia (n = 82) were examined in 2003, when the children were 7-11 years of age, and again in 2010 (Finnish Karelia) and 2012 (Russian Karelia). We analysed self-reported allergy symptoms and sensitization to common allergens by serum sIgE values. The skin (volar forearm) and nasal mucosa microbiota, collected in 2012 (aged 15-20 years), identified from DNA samples, were compared with multivariate methods.RESULTS:Asthma, hay fever, atopic eczema, self-reported rhinitis, as well as atopic sensitization, were threefold to 10-fold more common in Finland, as compared to Russian Karelia. Hay fever and peanut sensitization were almost non-existent in Russia. These patterns remained throughout the 10-year follow-up. Skin microbiota, as well as bacterial and fungal communities in nasal mucosa, was contrastingly different between the populations, best characterized by the diversity and abundance of genus Acinetobacter; more abundant and diverse in Russia. Overall, diversity was significantly higher among Russian subjects (Pskin < 0.0001, Pnasal-bacteria < 0.0001 and Pnasal-fungi < 0.01). Allergic diseases were not associated with microbial diversity in Finnish subjects.CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE:Differences in allergic phenotype, developed in early life, remain between populations. A parallel difference in the composition of skin and nasal microbiota suggests a potential underlying mechanism. Our results also suggest that high abundance and diversity of Acinetobacter might contribute to the low allergy prevalence in Russia. Implications of early-life exposure to Acinetobacter should be further investigated.",Significant disparities in allergy prevalence and microbiota between the young people in Finnish and Russian Karelia.,SUBMITTED,2020-06-06T21:49:10

Human population surveys have demonstrated that gut microbial resistomes reflect local antibiotics usage patterns, while previous small cohort studies based on single antibiotic exposures have shown varying degrees of antibiotic impact on the gut microbiota and their associated resistome. However, the role of resistomes of particular gut species in their ability to persist in the face of antibiotic treatment has not been systematically studied.Applying shotgun sequencing and quantitative metagenomics, we analyzed the partial eradication and subsequent regrowth of gut microbiota in 12 healthy young men over a 6 month period following a 4-day intervention with three broad-spectrum antibiotics. The gut microbial communities of the study subjects underwent profound compositional changes due to the treatment but slowly recovered to near-baseline compositions. Immediately after the treatment, the gut microbiota featured an increased relative abundance of opportunistic and proinflammatory bacterial species, and a decreased relative abundance of short chain fatty acid producers, while exhibiting an increased functional potential for multidrug efflux pumps and virulence factors. These enrichment trends were weaker after 8 days and mostly cleared out after 42 days. However, 9 common intestinal commensal species found at baseline and associated with short chain fatty production or efficient digestion of polysaccharides remained undetectable in most of the subjects even after 180 days.Carrying genes that confer resistance to the antibiotics used in this multidrug study had specific consequences for the survival and de novo colonization potential of microbial species. While species harboring beta-lactam resistance genes were positively selected during and after the intervention, those harboring glycopeptide or aminoglycoside resistance exhibited increased odds of de novo colonization but decreased odds of survival. Despite a mild long-lasting imprint following exposure to three antibiotics, the gut microbiota of healthy young adults are resilient to a broad-spectrum antibiotic intervention, and their recovery process is modulated by antibiotic resistance gene carriage.",Gut resistome modulates resilience and recovery of gut microbiota after broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment,SUBMITTED,2020-05-28T18:09:50

This pipeline includes purification of encapsulated RNA/DNA viruses, sequence-independent amplification, high throughput sequencing, integrated assembly of contigs, and screening through a series of filters to identify contigs specifically corresponding to viral sequences. We evaluated samples of honey bees and co-foraging non-Apis bee species (12 bee species in total) from 9 countries and 5 continents. We identified sequences corresponding to (+)ssRNA, (-)ssRNA, dsRNA, and ssDNA viruses. Overall, 127 contigs corresponding to novel viruses (previously not observed in bees), with 29 represented by >0.1% of the reads in a given sample. These 29 contigs corresponded to 9 viral families, including 6 viral families that have not been previously observed in bees.

This questions whether niche differentiation between microbes under competitive stress exists and if so, how it is maintained. Rumen microbes exist in a highly competitive, anaerobic environment, and compete for access to the limited nutrients available in the biomass consumed by the host. The rumen microbiome affects the efficiency and health of the host, and has been mined for novel enzymes and anti microbial peptides and is known as a potent contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. A better understanding of the structure and function of this community has large potential benefits. We generated separate metagenomic libraries from 14 Limousin cows. Following assembly, gene prediction and taxonomic assignment, SNPs were identified and functional isoform diversity (pN/pS) was calculated for each gene. The independent calculations from each sample were used to calculate confidence intervals for testing for diversity of function between microbes, a signature of niche differentiation. We identified significant differences in functional diversity between competing organisms in genes involved in carbon, amino-sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, suggesting adaptation to utilizing different routes for nutrient acquisition in the rumen. This suggests that a greater understanding of the rumen microbiome and considering macro-ecological concepts, such as successional change and adaptation, are likely to improve strategies for increasing the efficiency and health of the host and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",Metagenomic analyses of Rumen microbiomes reveals the functional isoforms driving microbial niche differentiation for nutrient acquisition and use,SUBMITTED,2020-05-22T03:08:26

A closed genome was obtained by differential coverage binning of metagenomes and long Nanopore reads. Genome annotation and metabolic reconstruction revealed an anaerobic chemoheterotrophic lifestyle in which the bacterium obtain energy and carbon from the fermentation of peptides, amino acids, and simple sugars to acetate, formate and hydrogen. In contrast to previously studied Acetothermia, the genome did not encode a functional acetyl-CoA pathway required for acetogenesis. Fluorescent in situ hybridization probes targeting Acetothermia were designed and used in combination with confocal laser scanning microscopy and atomic force microscopy. This revealed an unusual morphology composed of a central rod cell with bipolar prosthecae similar to those observed in Caulobacter and Asticcacaulis.

A metagenomic approach was taken complemented by nitrogen isotope determinations of fern biomass and detection of N2O released. Ribosomal RNA genes in sequenced DNA of natural ferns, their enriched leaf pockets and water filtrate from the surrounding ditch established that bacteria of A. filiculoides differed entirely from surrounding water and revealed species of the order Rhizobiales. Analyses of seven cultivated Azolla species confirmed persistent association with Rhizobiales. Two distinct near full-length Rhizobiales genomes were identified from leaf-pocket enriched samples from ditch grown A. filiculoides. Annotation revealed genes for denitrification but not N2-fixation. 15N2 incorporation was active in ferns with N. azollae but not in ferns without. N2O was not detectably released from surface sterilized ferns with the Rhizobiales. N2-fixing N. azollae, we conclude, dominated the microbiome of Azolla ferns.

To further characterize gut microbial community development in healthy versus malnourished infants/children, we performed a time-series metagenomic study of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) recovered from fecal samples collected during the first 30 months of postnatal life from eight pairs of mono- and dizygotic Malawian twins concordant for healthy growth, and 12 twin pairs discordant for SAM (either marasmus or kwashiorkor). Both members of discordant pairs were sampled just prior to, during and after treatment with a peanut-based RUTF. Using Random Forests and a dataset of 17,676 viral contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads of VLP DNAs, we identified viruses that distinguish different assembly stages of the gut microbiota in the concordant healthy twin pairs. This normal developmental program was impaired in both members of SAM discordant pairs and not repaired with RUTF. Phage plus viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae families of single-stranded eukaryotic viruses discriminate  discordant pairs from concordant healthy pairs. These results disclose that apparently healthy co-twins in discordant pairs have viromes indicative of familial risk for SAM and provide a human model for delineating normal versus perturbed postnatal acquisition and retention of the gut microbiotas viral component in populations at risk for malnutrition.",The gut DNA viromes of Malawian twins discordant for severe acute undernutrition,SUBMITTED,2020-05-21T21:59:24

To assess spatial, interpersonal, and temporal variance, samples were collected from eight anatomical skin sites of 16 healthy individuals over two months. Skin viral communities were dominated by tailed bacteriophages--viruses replicating on human cells were comparatively rare. Similar to the skin whole metagenome, viral community composition and diversity was strongly associated with the microenvironment of the site sampled, and temporal variation within an individual was small compared to differences between individuals. Virome communities were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style, indicating that many infections would be non-lethal to the host and provide an opportunity for gene transfer. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation. Among these, some spacers targeted phage found at different body sites, suggesting that CRISPR spacer acquisition may provide a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities.

However, there has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in hunter-gatherer populations, posing a gap in our knowledge of gut microbiota (GM)-host mutualism arising from a lifestyle that describes over 90% of human evolutionary history. Here, we present the first metagenomic analysis of GM from Hadza hunter-gatherers of Tanzania, showing a unique enrichment in metabolic pathways that align with the dietary and environmental factors characteristic of their foraging lifestyle. We found that the Hadza GM is adapted for broad spectrum carbohydrate metabolism, reflecting the complex polysaccharides in their diet. Furthermore, the Hadza GM is equipped for branched-chain amino acid degradation and aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Resistome functionality demonstrates the existence of antibiotic resistance genes in a population with little to no antibiotic exposure, indicating the ubiquitous presence of environmentally derived resistances. Our results demonstrate how the functional specificity of the GM correlates with environment and lifestyle, and how complexity from the exogenous environment is matched by endogenous homeostasis. The Hadza gut metagenome structure allows to appreciate the co-adaptive functional role of the GM in complementing the human physiology, providing a better understanding of the versatility of human life and subsistence.",Metagenome sequencing of the Hadza hunter-gatherer gut microbiota.,HARVESTED,2020-05-17T19:05:23

Since carbon dioxide has been detected as one of the most relevant drivers of global climate change, its potential storage and fate in soils has become key for predicting climate scenarios. Unfortunately, studies with a focus on the decomposition and driving factors are still lacking for precise modelling of the fluxes in a changing world. The main actors of carbon degradation in soils have not been fully identified, especially in regard to bacteria very little is known about their contribution to degradation of persistent carbon components. In the present study, the active microbial community involved in degrading 13C-labelled cellulose and lignin in forest soils was identified using a DNA stable isotopic probing (SIP) approach. Microbial activity assessed by measurements of 13CO2 increased with labelled substrate addition, during a 28 days incubation period. Within the vast microbial communities, bacterial and fungal members specialized in degrading cellulose (e.g. Devosia (Rhizobiales), Sebacinales), lignin (e.g. Sphingopyxis (Sphingomonadales), Paucibacter (Burkholderiales), Xylariales, Auriculariales, Helotiales), and both substrates (e.g. Caulobacter (Caulobacterales), Schizoporaceae, Orbiliales) have been identified. Over the course of the experiment, a successional shift from early degrading colonizers (e.g. Brevundimonas (Caulobacterales), Trichosporonales, Hymenochaetales, Gomphales) to late stage beneficiary microorganisms (e.g. Sphingopyxis (Sphingomonadales), Devosia (Rhizobiales), Orbiliales) became evident.

Interactions between the gut microbiome and fecal bile acid composition as a factor in colorectal cancer neoplasia have been postulated but evidence is limited to small cohorts and animal studies. Using banked stool samples collected as part of a phase III randomized clinical trial of UDCA for the prevention of colorectal adenomatous polyps, we compared change in the microbiome composition after a 3-year intervention in a subset of participants randomized to oral UDCA at 8-10 mg/kg of body weight per day (n = 198) or placebo (n = 203). Study participants randomized to UDCA experienced compositional changes in their microbiome that were statistically more similar to other individuals in the UDCA arm than to those in the placebo arm. This reflected a UDCA-associated shift in microbial community composition (P < 0.001), independent of sex, with no evidence of a UDCA effect on microbial richness (P > 0.05). These UDCA-associated shifts in microbial community distance metrics from baseline to end-of-study were not associated with risk of any or advanced adenoma (all P > 0.05) in men or women. Separate analyses of microbial networks revealed an overrepresentation of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the post-UDCA arm and an inverse relationship between F prausnitzii and Ruminococcus gnavus. In men who received UDCA, the overrepresentation of F prausnitzii and underrepresentation of R gnavus were more prominent in those with no adenoma recurrence at follow-up compared to men with recurrence. This relationship was not observed in women. Daily UDCA use modestly influences the relative abundance of microbial species in stool and affects the microbial network composition with suggestive evidence for sex-specific effects of UDCA on stool microbial community composition as a modifier of colorectal adenoma risk.[This text is derived from our Open Access publication of the same title as this project.]",Effects of ursodeoxycholic acid on the gut microbiome and colorectal adenoma development.,HARVESTED,2020-05-02T02:23:31

Monthly samples from two dairies were analyzed to capture the seasonal variations in the milk microbiota. Although there was a core microbiota present in milk samples from both dairies, the composition of the bacterial communities were significantly influenced by sampling month, processing stage and storage temperature. Overall, a higher abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) within the order Bacillales was detected in samples of raw and pasteurized milk from the spring and summer months, while Pseudomonadales and Lactobacillales OTUs were predominant in the winter months. OTUs belonging to the order Lactobacillales, Pseudomonadales, Clostridiales and Bacillales were significantly more abundant in milk samples taken immediately after pasteurization compared to raw milk samples. During storage of milk in cartons at 4 C, the bacterial composition remained stable throughout the product shelf life, while storage at 8 C significantly increased the abundance of OTUs belonging to the genus Bacillus and the plate count levels of presumptive Bacillus cereus.

Two most dominant mycorrhizal types in temperate forests, arbuscular mycorrhizal and ectomycorrhizal plant species, can drive distinct dynamics in which the composition of the fungal community changes due to associations with plant community composition, and these changes differentially feed back on plant growth through the effects of (i) plant-fungus compatibility and (ii) common fungal networks. Here we investigate how plant community development is linked with mycorrhizal types, contrasting the effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) versus ectomycorrhizal (EcM) associations on seedling establishment. By simulating the scenario where established tree community modifies the soil fungal component (i.e., AM versus EcM inocula) and alters the competitive environment for new seedlings, we found that competition for soil nutrients influenced seedling establishment. The results showed that compatible seedlings had significantly greater leaf and root biomasses than incompatible seedlings, a benefit from the presence of established competitors through enhancing positive nutrient feedbacks. While plant-soil feedback mediated tree-seedling interactions for both AM and EcM associations, the estimated compatibility effects were more positive for EcM relative to AM associations. Notably, this coincided with the more pronounced sharing of fungal species and more structured formation of common fungal network in EcM systems compared to AM systems. Together these results suggest the link between seedling establishment and mycorrhizal functional differentiation.",Contrasting the roles of mycorrhizal compatibility in community development between arbuscular- versus ecto-mycorhizal systems,HARVESTED,2020-02-14T14:33:40

Like several other immune-mediated diseases, asthma pathogenesis is being studied in the context of the hygiene hypothesis. Antibiotic-driven gut microbial shifts exclusively in the neonatal period increase airway inflammation in mice. We hypothesized that similar microbial changes in infant humans have a causal role in disease. To test this, 319 children enrolled in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) study were grouped into four phenotypes: atopic + wheeze (AW), atopic only, wheeze only, and controls, based on clinical data at 1 year. The fecal microbiome of 3-month and 1-year samples was evaluated by 16S rRNA gene sequencing (Illumina). A subset of samples in the AW and control groups was selected for qPCR, short chain fatty acid (SCFA) and urine metabolomic analyses. Finally, germ-free mice were inoculated with feces from one AW patient or with the same inoculum plus 4 bacterial strains found more commonly in controls. These mice were bred and the F1 generation was evaluated for OVA-induced airway inflammation. Results: At 3 months of age, 4 OTUs were identified by sequencing and qPCR as decreased in AW children, who also had a significantly increased risk of asthma diagnosis, based on their asthma predictive index at 3 years of age. These children exhibited decreased fecal acetate and propionate, and alterations in bacterial and host-derived metabolites mostly at 3 months of age. Finally, oral inoculation of mice with these 4 bacterial strains ameliorated airway inflammation. These results reveal taxonomic and functional gut microbial changes in infants associated with an increased risk of asthma. Decreased production of SCFA at this young age may lead to changes in energy harvest, bile acid and urobilinogen metabolism.

A challenge is to complement these efforts with a preclinical research pipeline that tests the degree to which a person's physiologic or pathological phenotype can be ascribed to their microbiome and that offers an opportunity to evaluate potential strategies for microbiome-based therapeutics. Here we illustrate such a pre-clinical pipeline by transplanting previously frozen, uncultured fecal microbiota samples from four sets of adult female mono- and dizygotic twins discordant for obesity into groups of adult germ-free C57Bl/6J mice fed a low-fat, plant polysaccharide-rich diet. Capture of a human donor's microbiota in recipient mice is highly reproducible within and between experiments. The increased adiposity phenotype of obese co-twins is transmissible not only with the intact uncultured fecal communities, but with bacterial culture collections generated from these fecal samples. Co-housing mice five days after they received transplants of culture collections from the obese or lean member of a discordant twin pair ameliorated the increased adiposity phenotype that normally develops in recipients of the obese donor's culture collection, while having no effect on the adiposity phenotype of recipients of the lean co-twin's culture collection. These results correlate with taxonomic and metabolic changes in co-housed mice harboring the obese co-twin's culture collection.

The study included 340 women diagnosed with CIN 2+ (cases) and 90 diagnosed with CIN 1 (non-cases). Microbiota composition was determined by Illumina sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene amplified from DNA extracted from cervical mucus samples. Measures of alpha/beta-diversity were not associated with either CIN severity or oxidative DNA damage. However, a cervical mucosal community type (CT) dominated by L. iners and unclassified Lactobacillus spp. was associated with CIN 2+ (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.279.55). Sequence reads mapping to Lactobacillaceae, Lactobacillus, L. reuteri, and several subgenus level Lactobacillus operational taxonomic units were also associated with CIN 2+ when examined independently (effect size >2.0; P < 0.05).

Our results indicate that SAM is associated with significant relative microbiota immaturity that is only partially ameliorated following two widely used nutritional interventions. Immaturity is also evident in less severe forms of malnutrition and correlates with anthropometric measurements. Microbiota maturity indices provide a microbial measure of human postnatal development, a way of classifying malnourished states, and a parameter for judging therapeutic efficacy. More prolonged interventions with existing or new therapeutic foods and/or addition of gut microbes may be needed to achieve enduring repair of gut microbiota immaturity in childhood malnutrition and improve clinical outcomes.

The lack of metrics for quantifying development of the gut microbiota and mucosal immune system has hindered the ability to dissect the effects of microbial, host and environmental factors on their co-development. Therefore, we subjected fecal samples, collected monthly during the first 3 postnatal years from 40 healthy USA twin pairs, to bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing and to fluorescence-activated cell sorting to distinguish IgA-targeted from non-targeted taxa. Applying a machine-learning algorithm (Random Forests), we identified a set of 25 age-discriminatory bacterial taxa whose patterns of representation define a program of microbiota assembly/maturation shared across twin pairs. Remarkably, IgA responses to 30 taxa, including a subset of the age-discriminatory organisms, converge on a pattern shared across twin pairs by the second postnatal year; the observed targeting patterns were not simple reflections of relative abundance or taxonomy. Zygosity, delivery mode, and breast versus formula feeding had small albeit statistically significant effects on targeting. In follow-up studies, young germ-free mice were colonized with fecal microbiota obtained from two twin pairs at 6 and 18 months of age, and fed a sequence of human diets designed to simulate the transition from milk feeding to complementary foods. Distinct age-associated differences in mucosal IgA responses to the transplanted human microbiota were recapitulated in both diet contexts for both twin pairs, suggesting that intrinsic properties of their community members play a dominant role in dictating IgA responses.  This approach can be used to define gut mucosal immune development in health and disease states, and help identify ways to repair or prevent perturbations in this facet of host immunity.",Characterizing postnatal co-development of the gut microbiota and mucosal IgA responses in healthy twin pairs and a gnotobiotic mouse model,SUBMITTED,2019-12-07T07:43:23

Key members of the Lachnospiraceae family, such as the genus Blautia and some related species, were significantly reduced in patients compared to controls. Moreover, consistent with depletion of short chain fatty acids-producing bacteria, genera and species within the Lachnospiraceae family (Butyrivibrio, Pseudobutyrivibrio, Coprococcus, Roseburia and Roseburia faecis) were also decreased.
